# 30-days-projects-challenge

I am practicing everyday one challenge in the front end development domain by doing daily 1 project.

I have used "Submlime text" editor IDE for typing the code.
I have linked CSS and Javascript files to the .html file instead of writing everything in the same file

make sure the file paths  for all 3 files are same and then, there you go, you are ready to run the HTML file and see the result in browser.
